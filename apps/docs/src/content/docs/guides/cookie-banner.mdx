The Cookie Banner component provides an elegant way to obtain and manage cookie consent from your users. It handles all the complexity of privacy regulations while providing a smooth user experience that integrates naturally with your application.

## Understanding Cookie Consent

Before diving into implementation, let's understand what makes a cookie banner effective. A good cookie banner needs to:

- Inform users about data collection clearly and concisely
- Obtain explicit consent before setting non-essential cookies
- Provide easy ways to accept, reject, or customize preferences
- Remember user choices across sessions
- Meet legal requirements across different jurisdictions

Our Cookie Banner component handles all of these requirements automatically, while remaining fully customizable to match your application's design.

## Quick Start

Let's add a basic cookie banner to your application. First, install the package:

```bash
npm install @koroflow/elements
```

Then add the banner to your root component:

```tsx
import { CookieBanner } from '@koroflow/elements'
import { ConsentManagerProvider } from '@koroflow/elements/headless'

function App() {
  return (
    <ConsentManagerProvider>
      <YourApp />
      <CookieBanner />
    </ConsentManagerProvider>
  )
}
```

That's it! The banner will automatically:
- Appear on first visit
- Remember user choices
- Handle consent management
- Stay compliant with privacy laws

## Component Architecture

The Cookie Banner uses a compound component pattern, giving you complete control over its structure when needed. Think of it like building blocks – you can use the pre-assembled version, or arrange the pieces yourself for custom layouts.

```tsx
// Pre-assembled version (recommended for most cases)
<CookieBanner
  title="We value your privacy"
  description="We use cookies to enhance your experience"
/>

// Custom layout using compound components
<CookieBanner.Root>
  <CookieBanner.Card>
    <CookieBanner.Header>
      <CookieBanner.Title>
        Custom Title
      </CookieBanner.Title>
      <CookieBanner.Description>
        Your detailed description here
      </CookieBanner.Description>
    </CookieBanner.Header>
    <CookieBanner.Footer>
      <CookieBanner.FooterSubGroup>
        <CookieBanner.RejectButton>
          Decline All
        </CookieBanner.RejectButton>
        <CookieBanner.CustomizeButton>
          Preferences
        </CookieBanner.CustomizeButton>
      </CookieBanner.FooterSubGroup>
      <CookieBanner.AcceptButton>
        Accept All
      </CookieBanner.AcceptButton>
    </CookieBanner.Footer>
  </CookieBanner.Card>
</CookieBanner.Root>
```

## Customization

The Cookie Banner is designed to adapt to your application's visual style. Here are the main ways to customize its appearance:

### Using Themes

The theme prop provides a straightforward way to customize the banner's appearance:

```tsx
<CookieBanner
  theme={{
    "cookie-banner.root": "fixed bottom-0 w-full bg-white p-4",
    "cookie-banner.title": "text-xl font-bold",
    "cookie-banner.description": "text-gray-600 mt-2",
    "cookie-banner.footer": "mt-4 flex justify-end gap-2"
  }}
/>
```

### Using CSS Modules

For more traditional styling approaches, you can use CSS modules:

```tsx
import styles from './cookie-banner.module.css'

<CookieBanner
  theme={{
    "cookie-banner.root": styles.banner,
    "cookie-banner.title": styles.title,
    "cookie-banner.description": styles.description
  }}
/>
```

### Using Existing Components

You can integrate your own component library using the `asChild` prop:

```tsx
import { Button } from './your-components'

<CookieBanner.AcceptButton asChild>
  <Button variant="primary">Accept All Cookies</Button>
</CookieBanner.AcceptButton>
```

## Accessibility

The Cookie Banner is built with accessibility in mind:

- Proper ARIA roles and labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Screen reader announcements
- High contrast support

These features work automatically, ensuring all users can interact with your privacy controls effectively.

## API Reference

### CookieBanner

The main component accepts these props:

| Prop | Type | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|---------|

| description | ReactNode | Banner description | "We use cookies..." |
| theme | CookieBannerTheme | Theme configuration | {} |

### Compound Components

Each compound component is designed for specific functionality:

- `CookieBanner.Root`: The container component

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines for optimal implementation:

1. Place the banner at the root level of your application
2. Keep the title and description clear and concise
3. Use the pre-assembled version unless you need custom layouts
4. Test the banner across different screen sizes
5. Ensure your theme maintains sufficient contrast ratios

## Common Pitfalls

Watch out for these common issues:

- Blocking essential functionality before consent
- Overwhelming users with too much information
- Poor mobile responsiveness
- Insufficient color contrast
- Missing keyboard navigation
